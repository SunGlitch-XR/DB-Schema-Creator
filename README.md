🗂️ Database Schema Creator 📊

Database Schema Creator is a Python tool that visualizes database schemas using the Graphviz library. It takes a CSV file with information about tables, columns, data types, and relationships, and generates a graphical representation of the database schema. Plus, it creates .NET classes and DTOs from the schema. Perfect for understanding complex databases and sharing with team members! 🎉💼

## 🚀 Features

- **Show Relationships:** Connects tables based on foreign key relationships. 🔗
- **Export to PDF:** Creates a PDF file for easy sharing and documentation. 📑
- **Generate .NET Classes:** Creates .NET classes with proper data annotations and XML comments. 🏗️
- **Create DTOs:** Automatically generates Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for each table. 🔄
